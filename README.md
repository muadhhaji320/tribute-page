# tribute-page
A tribute page is basically an overview of someone whom we admire in our life. In this poject,<br> 
we are creating a tribute webpage of Late A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Sir using HTML and CSS. <br>
We will add an image of him at the center (below the title) and create a box beneath that image. <br>
Inside that box, we will write a few of his achievements and details. We will use div tag and p tag <br>
to write the details and img tag for image. Then using CSS, we will align and beautify the design. 
### Approach:

- In the <body> element, we will give the title of the page using h1 tag after that <br>
  we will add an image of him in the img tag with some caption. We will create<br>
another div tag and write all the contents (using p tags). We have also given ID<br>
for each tag so that we can beautify the design using respective-ID in the CSS file.
- In the CSS section, we have basically maintained a central design and used box-shadow<br>
to create box effect around the main content.
